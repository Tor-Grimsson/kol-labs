  summary:
    'Clifford strange attractor iterated for 20k points per frame, then warped and clipped to the glyph SDF. The attractor does not naturally respect the shape — this shows why the shortlist deprioritizes attractors for letterform fill, but the pattern is gorgeous in its own right.',
  helps:
    'Evidence for the deprioritization in the research shortlist. The attractor ignores the mask — most of the iteration is thrown away on the clip test. Included so you can see why it is not a fit.',
